A web-based frontend for executing OVM1 (Optimism Legacy) withdrawals to Ethereum mainnet, styled to match the [Optimism Console](https://console.optimism.io/).

## Features

- üé® **Optimism-styled UI** - Clean, modern interface matching the official Optimism console
- üåô **Light/Dark Mode** - Toggle between light and dark themes (light mode default)
- üîç **Smart Search** - Look up withdrawals by transaction hash or wallet address
- üìä **Withdrawal Details** - View comprehensive withdrawal information
- üöÄ **One-click Execution** - Execute withdrawals directly from the web interface
- üîí **Authentication Options** - Private key authentication (wallet connection coming soon)
- üì± **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open in Browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

### Web Interface

1. **Search for a Withdrawal**

   - **By Transaction Hash**: Enter the specific transaction hash (e.g., `0x123...`)
   - **By Wallet Address**: Enter any wallet address to find all withdrawals from/to that address
   - Click "Search" to fetch withdrawal details
   - If multiple withdrawals are found for an address, select from the results list
   - Or browse and select from the "Recent Withdrawals" list

2. **Configure Authentication**

   - **Option A (Recommended)**: Click "Use Private Key" to authenticate directly
   - **Option B (Coming Soon)**: Wallet connection with MetaMask integration
   - Set L1 RPC URL (Ethereum mainnet)
   - Set L2 RPC URL (Optimism mainnet)

3. **Execute Withdrawal**
   - Click "Execute Withdrawal" to prove and relay
   - Monitor the status messages for progress
   - Transaction hash will be displayed upon success

### Command Line Interface

The original CLI is still available:

```bash
node index.js exec --hash <hash> --pk <private-key> --l1-rpc <url> --l2-rpc <url>
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/withdrawals` - List recent withdrawals (limited to 100)
- `GET /api/withdrawal/:hash` - Get specific withdrawal details by hash
- `GET /api/search/:query` - Search withdrawals by hash or wallet address
- `POST /api/execute-withdrawal` - Execute a withdrawal

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Optimism-inspired design
- **Backend**: Express.js server with CORS support
- **Data**: Pre-parsed withdrawal data from `data/withdrawals_parsed.json`
- **Blockchain**: Ethers.js and Optimism SDK for withdrawal execution
